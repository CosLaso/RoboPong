# RoboPong
## Robotics Project - 41013

This repository contains all the code for our Industrial Robotics project - 'RoboPong'. 
RoboPong aims to track the trajectory of a ping pong ball being thrown at it and will catch it in a cup being held by the robotic arm's pneumatic gripper.

The robot of choice for this task is the Dobot Magician (see below).
The project will include both a simulation of how the robotic arm runs - simulated through the use of MATLAB with ROS (Robotics Operating System).
As well as code to animate the robotic arm in real life to perform the required task.
